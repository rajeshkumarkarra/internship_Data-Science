It's important to emphasize that wormholes are still largely hypothetical, and their existence hasn't been confirmed observationally.  Our understanding is based on theoretical physics, primarily Einstein's theory of general relativity.\n","\n","Here's a breakdown:\n","\n","**1. The Foundation: Einstein's General Relativity and Spacetime**\n","\n","*   **Spacetime:** General relativity describes gravity not as a force, but as a curvature of spacetime.  Spacetime is a four-dimensional concept combining three spatial dimensions (length, width, height) with time.  Massive objects warp this fabric of spacetime.\n","*   **Einstein Field Equations:** These equations relate the curvature of spacetime to the distribution of mass and energy within it.  They're incredibly complex, but they provide the mathematical framework for understanding how gravity works.\n","*   **Theoretical Possibility:** The Einstein Field Equations *allow* for solutions that describe wormholes.  This doesn't mean they *do* exist, but it opens the door to their theoretical possibility.\n","\n","**2.  The Classical Wormhole (Einstein-Rosen Bridge)**\n","\n","*   **The Original Concept:**  The first theoretical description of a wormhole came from Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen in 1935.  It's often called the Einstein-Rosen bridge.\n","*   **Black Hole Connection:**  Their initial idea envisioned a wormhole connecting *two black holes*.  Specifically, a black hole at one end and a \"white hole\" at the other. A white hole is a theoretical time-reversed black hole, where instead of nothing being able to escape a black hole, nothing can enter a white hole.\n","*   **Instability:**  The major problem with this classical Einstein-Rosen bridge is that it is inherently unstable.  The slightest disturbance or influx of matter would cause it to collapse instantly, pinching off before anything could traverse it.  Imagine trying to walk across a bridge that crumbles the moment you step on it.  These wormholes are considered *non-traversable*.\n","*   **Singularities:** These type of wormholes are connected to singularities, points of infinite density and curvature, that are at the center of Black Holes. Navigating those is believed impossible.\n","\n","**3. Traversable Wormholes and Exotic Matter**\n","\n","*   **The Need for Exotic Matter:**  To keep a wormhole open and prevent it from collapsing, physicists hypothesize the need for **exotic matter**.\n","*   **Exotic Matter Defined:** Exotic matter is theoretical matter that possesses a negative mass density or, more accurately, violates certain energy conditions (like the Weak Energy Condition) that are usually assumed to hold true for ordinary matter.\n","*   **Negative Energy Density and Repulsive Gravity:**  Negative energy density would create a kind of \"repulsive gravity\" that would counteract the collapsing forces of the wormhole.  Imagine pushing the walls of the wormhole outward to keep it from closing.\n","*   **Casimir Effect (Weak Analogy):** The Casimir effect, where a vacuum between two closely spaced plates exhibits a negative energy density in a very limited sense, is sometimes cited as a weak analogy.  However, the Casimir effect doesn't produce nearly enough negative energy to stabilize a wormhole.\n","*   **Problems with Exotic Matter:**\n","    *   **Hypothetical:** The biggest problem is that we have never observed exotic matter with the required properties. Its existence is purely theoretical.\n","    *   **Stability of Exotic Matter:** Even if it exists, it's unclear if exotic matter would be stable enough to maintain a wormhole. It might decay or interact with ordinary matter in unpredictable ways.\n","    *   **Creating Exotic Matter:** If exotic matter is so bizarre, how could it be created or harvested to build a wormhole?\n","\n","**4.  Quantum Foam and Microscopic Wormholes (Speculative)**\n","\n","*   **Quantum Foam:** At the Planck scale (the smallest possible units of length and time), spacetime might not be smooth and continuous, but rather a frothy, fluctuating \"quantum foam\" where virtual particles pop in and out of existence.\n","*   **Microscopic Wormholes:** Some theories suggest that tiny, short-lived wormholes might spontaneously arise and disappear within this quantum foam. These would be far too small and unstable for any practical use.\n","*   **Enlarging Microscopic Wormholes (Highly Speculative):**  A far more radical idea is that it might be possible, in principle, to somehow \"grab\" one of these microscopic wormholes and enlarge it to a macroscopic size, using, again, exotic matter to stabilize it.  This is extremely speculative and faces enormous technological and theoretical challenges.\n","\n","**5.  Creation Scenarios (Even More Speculative)**\n","\n","Assuming exotic matter exists and can be manipulated, here are some purely hypothetical scenarios for wormhole creation:\n","\n","*   **Artificial Creation:**  Building a machine that can warp spacetime to an extreme degree, using vast amounts of energy and exotic matter to create a wormhole.  This is far beyond our current technological capabilities.\n","*   **Primordial Wormholes:**  Wormholes might have formed in the very early universe, during the Big Bang or shortly thereafter, under extreme conditions. These primordial wormholes might still exist, though finding and stabilizing one would be incredibly difficult.\n","*   **Black Hole Manipulation (Highly Unlikely):** Trying to manipulate a black hole and a white hole (if they exist) using exotic matter to connect them into a traversable wormhole.

It's important to remember that persistent bad breath can have a number of underlying causes and should be evaluated by a medical professional.\n","\n","**I. Food-Related Causes:**\n","\n","This is probably the most common category.\n","\n","*   **Garlic, Onions, and Strong Spices:** These contain volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) that are absorbed into the bloodstream and then exhaled through the lungs, leading to a noticeable odor. The smell can linger for hours or even days.\n","*   **Coffee:** Can reduce saliva flow and also contains compounds that can contribute to bad breath.\n","*   **Sugary Foods and Drinks:** Sugar fuels bacteria in the mouth, leading to increased acid production and VSC formation.\n","*   **Protein-Rich Diets (Especially if Low in Carbs):** When the body doesn't have enough carbohydrates to burn for energy, it starts burning fat, which produces ketones. Ketones can be released in the breath, creating a distinct, sometimes fruity or acetone-like odor.\n","*   **Milk and Dairy Products:** Contain amino acids that bacteria in the mouth can break down, leading to bad breath.\n","*   **Insufficient Water Intake:** Dehydration reduces saliva production, creating a dry mouth, which promotes bacterial growth.\n","*   **Food Stuck in Teeth/Gums:** Trapped food particles decompose, creating a breeding ground for bacteria and leading to unpleasant odors.\n","*   **Alcohol:** Dries the mouth, leading to increased bacterial activity.\n","\n","**II. Nutritional Deficiencies and Bad Breath:**\n","\n","While not a direct cause in the same way as food, certain deficiencies can indirectly contribute to bad breath by affecting oral health, the immune system, or other bodily functions.\n","\n","*   **Vitamin C Deficiency (Scurvy):** Severe vitamin C deficiency leads to scurvy, which can cause bleeding gums, loose teeth, and impaired wound healing in the mouth.  The bleeding and inflammation can create an environment where bacteria thrive, contributing to bad breath.\n","*   **Zinc Deficiency:** Zinc is important for immune function and wound healing. Zinc deficiency can potentially impair the mouth's ability to fight off infection and inflammation, indirectly contributing to bad breath.\n","*   **B Vitamin Deficiencies (Especially B3 - Niacin):** Severe deficiencies (e.g., Pellagra with Niacin) can cause glossitis (inflammation of the tongue) and other oral health problems that can contribute to bad breath.\n","*   **Iron Deficiency:** In rare cases, severe iron deficiency anemia can be associated with glossitis, which can contribute to bad breath.\n","*   **General Malnutrition:** Overall poor nutrition weakens the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to oral infections and gum disease, which can lead to bad breath.\n","*   **Specific Dietary Imbalances:** Diets that are excessively high in protein but low in carbohydrates can lead to ketosis, where the body burns fat for energy and produces ketones, causing bad breath. This isn't necessarily a deficiency, but a dietary imbalance.\n","* **Dehydration:** This is the most common problem related to vitamin deficiencies that contribute to bad breath. Because Vitamins help the body absorb and process water more efficiently, a Vitamin deficiency leads to dehydration. This causes a dry mouth, which is a common symptom of bad breath.\n","\n","**Important Considerations:**\n","\n","*   **Oral Hygiene:** The most important factor in preventing bad breath is good oral hygiene.  Brushing twice a day, flossing daily, and cleaning the tongue help remove food particles and bacteria.\n","*   **Dry Mouth (Xerostomia):**  Anything that reduces saliva production (medications, certain medical conditions, mouth breathing) can contribute to bad breath. Saliva helps wash away food particles and neutralize acids.\n","*   **Gum Disease (Gingivitis and Periodontitis):** Gum disease is a major cause of bad breath.  Bacteria thrive in the pockets between the teeth and gums, producing foul-smelling compounds.\n","*   **Medical Conditions:**  Certain medical conditions, such as sinusitis, postnasal drip, diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease, and respiratory infections, can also cause bad breath.\n","*   **Medications:** Some medications can cause dry mouth or release chemicals that contribute to bad breath.\n","*   **Tonsil Stones (Tonsilloliths):** These are small, white or yellowish deposits that form in the crevices of the tonsils. They contain bacteria and debris and can have a very strong, unpleasant odor.\n","*   **Smoking/Tobacco Use:** Smoking dries the mouth, irritates the gums, and stains teeth, all of which contribute to bad breath.\n","\n","**When to See a Doctor or Dentist:**\n","\n","*   Persistent bad breath that doesn't improve with good oral hygiene.\n","*   Signs of gum disease (bleeding gums, red or swollen gums, loose teeth).\n","*   Dry mouth that is interfering with your daily life.\n","*   Any other concerning symptoms (sore throat, nasal congestion, etc.).\n","\n","**In Summary:**\n","\n","While nutritional deficiencies *can* indirectly contribute to bad breath by affecting oral health and immune function, the most common causes are related to food choices, poor oral hygiene, dry mouth, and underlying medical conditions. Focus on good oral hygiene, a balanced diet, and staying hydrated. If the problem persists, consult a dentist or doctor to rule out other potential causes.\n","\n"]}],"source":["client = genai.Client(api_key = GOOGLE_API_KEY)\n","\n","response = client.models.generate_content(\n","    model = \"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n","    contents = \"Causes of smell from the mouth, whether it is because of Vitamin defeciency or food\"\n",")\n","\n","print(response.text)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"id":"7d50feeb","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-16T07:34:09.64078Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-16T07:34:09.640475Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-16T07:34:09.963685Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-16T07:34:09.962458Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.332871,"end_time":"2025-05-16T07:34:09.966065","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-05-16T07:34:09.633194","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["models/chat-bison-001\n","models/text-bison-001\n","models/embedding-gecko-001\n","models/gemini-1.0-pro-vision-latest\n","models/gemini-pro-vision\n","models/gemini-1.5-pro-latest\n","models/gemini-1.5-pro-001\n","models/gemini-1.5-pro-002\n","models/gemini-1.5-pro\n","models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest\n","models/gemini-1.5-flash-001\n","models/gemini-1.5-flash-001-tuning\n","models/gemini-1.5-flash\n","models/gemini-1.5-flash-002\n","models/gemini-1.5-flash-8b\n","models/gemini-1.5-flash-8b-001\n","models/gemini-1.5-flash-8b-latest\n","models/gemini-1.5-flash-8b-exp-0827\n","models/gemini-1.5-flash-8b-exp-0924\n","models/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25\n","models/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25\n","models/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17\n","models/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17-thinking\n","models/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06\n","models/gemini-2.0-flash-exp\n","models/gemini-2.0-flash\n","models/gemini-2.0-flash-001\n","models/gemini-2.0-flash-exp-image-generation\n","models/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001\n","models/gemini-2.0-flash-lite\n","models/gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation\n","models/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-preview-02-05\n","models/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-preview\n","models/gemini-2.0-pro-exp\n","models/gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05\n","models/gemini-exp-1206\n","models/gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21\n","models/gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp\n","models/gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-1219\n","models/learnlm-2.0-flash-experimental\n","models/gemma-3-1b-it\n","models/gemma-3-4b-it\n","models/gemma-3-12b-it\n","models/gemma-3-27b-it\n","models/embedding-001\n","models/text-embedding-004\n","models/gemini-embedding-exp-03-07\n","models/gemini-embedding-exp\n","models/aqa\n","models/imagen-3.0-generate-002\n","models/gemini-2.0-flash-live-001\n"]}],"source":["for model in client.models.list():\n","    print(model.name)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":15,"id":"c60750f0","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-16T07:34:09.982216Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-16T07:34:09.981886Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-16T07:34:10.142669Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-16T07:34:10.1414Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.170894,"end_time":"2025-05-16T07:34:10.144466","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-05-16T07:34:09.973572","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["{'description': 'Gemini 2.0 Flash',\n"," 'display_name': 'Gemini 2.0 Flash',\n"," 'input_token_limit': 1048576,\n"," 'name': 'models/gemini-2.0-flash',\n"," 'output_token_limit': 8192,\n"," 'supported_actions': ['generateContent', 'countTokens', 'createCachedContent'],\n"," 'tuned_model_info': {},\n"," 'version': '2.0'}\n"]}],"source":["from pprint import pprint\n","\n","for model in client.models.list():\n","    if model.name == 'models/gemini-2.0-flash':\n","        pprint(model.to_json_dict())\n","        break"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":16,"id":"6a015ece","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-16T07:34:10.159879Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-16T07:34:10.159489Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-16T07:34:11.887649Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-16T07:34:11.886347Z"},"papermill":{"duration":1.737892,"end_time":"2025-05-16T07:34:11.889416","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-05-16T07:34:10.151524","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Einstein's E=mc², arguably the most famous equation in physics, reveals the profound relationship between energy (E) and mass (m).

He possessed a spirit as fiery as his ginger fur and an insatiable curiosity that buzzed beneath his whiskers. While the other cats of Willow Creek contentedly napped in sunbeams and chased dust bunnies, Jasper dreamed of adventure. He’d stare longingly at the rustling leaves of the ancient oak in the garden, convinced they held whispers of far-off lands.\n","\n","One crisp autumn morning, the whispers became too loud to ignore. The wind carried a scent unlike any Jasper had encountered before - a mixture of pine needles, damp earth, and something subtly sweet, like wild berries. He knew, with a certainty that settled deep in his feline soul, that adventure awaited him beyond the garden fence.\n","\n","He squeezed under the worn wooden slats, a surge of exhilaration bubbling within him. The world outside was a tapestry of vibrant colours he'd only glimpsed from his sun-drenched window. He followed his nose, past whispering cornfields and gurgling brooks, each step a victory against the mundane life he'd left behind.\n","\n","The scent led him to the edge of the Whispering Woods, a place spoken of in hushed tones by the other cats. They claimed it was home to grumpy badgers and owls with piercing eyes. But Jasper wasn't deterred. He was Jasper, the adventurer.\n","\n","The woods swallowed him whole. Sunlight dappled through the canopy, painting the forest floor in shifting patterns. He navigated around towering ferns, their fronds tickling his nose, and hopped over moss-covered logs, each step a silent dance. He stalked a plump field mouse (which, after a few unsuccessful pounces, escaped into the undergrowth) and chased a kaleidoscope of butterflies that fluttered through the air.\n","\n","He encountered a grumpy badger, just as the stories warned. It grumbled and snapped, its little eyes narrowed. Jasper, normally quick to back down from confrontation, stood his ground. He puffed up his fur, let out a low hiss, and, to his own surprise, found himself lecturing the badger on the importance of kindness and the beauty of sharing the woods. The badger, bewildered by this unexpected display of ginger-furred audacity, simply huffed and waddled away.\n","\n","As twilight painted the sky in hues of orange and violet, Jasper stumbled upon a hidden glade. In the centre stood an ancient, gnarled apple tree, its branches laden with ripe, ruby-red fruit. The sweet scent he'd followed was strongest here. He’d never tasted anything so delicious.\n","\n","Curled beneath the apple tree, his belly full and his heart content, Jasper realized that adventure wasn't just about the destination. It was about the journey, the challenges overcome, and the unexpected friendships made along the way (even with grumpy badgers).\n","\n","The next morning, he retraced his steps, the memory of the Whispering Woods etched in his heart. He squeezed back under the garden fence, greeted by the familiar scent of his home and the sleepy meows of the other cats.\n","\n","They asked him where he’d been. He simply purred, a secret smile playing on his lips. He couldn't possibly explain the magic he'd found, the courage he'd discovered, or the taste of wild apples on his tongue. He just knew that from now on, Jasper the cat would always be Jasper, the adventurer, forever dreaming of the rustling leaves and the whispers beyond the garden fence.
