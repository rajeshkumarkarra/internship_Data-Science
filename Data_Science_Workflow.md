# 🔁 Data Science Workflow

## 📌 Overview
Data Science is an iterative process that transforms raw data into actionable insights and deployable models. Here's a typical end-to-end workflow.

---

## 🧩 1. Problem Definition
**Goal:** Understand the domain problem clearly.

**Tasks:**
- Define the business/research question
- Set objectives and success metrics
- Understand constraints (data, time, compute)

**Tools/Notes:**
- Stakeholder interviews
- Domain knowledge
- Jupyter Notebooks for ideation

---

## 🗃️ 2. Data Collection
**Goal:** Gather relevant data from various sources.

**Sources:**
- CSV, Excel, Databases (SQL/NoSQL)
- APIs, Web scraping
- Sensor data, logs

**Python Tools:**
```python
import pandas as pd
import requests
import sqlite3
```

---

## 🧹 3. Data Cleaning
**Goal:** Prepare the data for analysis by handling missing or inconsistent data.

**Tasks:**
- Handle missing values
- Remove duplicates
- Outlier detection
- Data type conversion

**Python Tools:**
```python
df.dropna(), df.fillna(), df.duplicated(), df.astype()
```

---

## 📊 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**Goal:** Understand patterns, trends, and relationships in data.

**Tasks:**
- Summary statistics
- Data visualization
- Feature relationships

**Python Tools:**
```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.pairplot(df)
df.describe()
df.corr()
```

---

## 🔧 5. Feature Engineering
**Goal:** Transform raw data into meaningful features.

**Tasks:**
- Normalization, scaling
- Encoding (One-Hot, Label)
- Binning, polynomial features
- Feature selection

**Python Tools:**
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
```

---

## 🤖 6. Model Building
**Goal:** Train and evaluate predictive models.

**Tasks:**
- Split data: Train/Test/Validation
- Train model
- Cross-validation

**Python Tools:**
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
```

---

## 🧪 7. Model Evaluation
**Goal:** Quantify model performance.

**Metrics:**
- Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC
- Regression: RMSE, MAE, R²

**Python Tools:**
```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
```

---

## 🔄 8. Model Tuning
**Goal:** Improve model with hyperparameter optimization.

**Methods:**
- Grid search, Random search
- Bayesian optimization

**Python Tools:**
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV
```

---

## 🚀 9. Deployment
**Goal:** Make the model accessible to users or systems.

**Methods:**
- REST APIs with Flask/FastAPI
- Docker containers
- Streamlit/Dash apps

**Tools:**
```bash
Flask, FastAPI, Docker, Streamlit, GitHub Actions
```

---

## 📈 10. Monitoring and Maintenance
**Goal:** Track model performance in production.

**Tasks:**
- Drift detection
- Retraining pipelines
- Logging and alerting

**Tools:**
- MLflow
- Prometheus + Grafana
- Airflow for pipelines

---

## 🔁 11. Iteration
**Goal:** Continuous improvement as new data and feedback arrive.

**Approach:**
- Close feedback loops
- Re-evaluate metrics
- Re-engineer features and models
