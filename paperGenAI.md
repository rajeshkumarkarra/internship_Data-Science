+++ {"part":"abstract"}
Generative AI (GenAI) represents a powerful class of machine learning models capable of producing high-quality content, including text, images, audio, and code. With the rapid evolution of models like GPT-4, Gemini, and open-source alternatives from Hugging Face, GenAI has found applications in diverse domains such as healthcare, education, creative arts, and software engineering. This paper explores the foundational technologies behind GenAI, practical use cases, code implementations, and how to integrate Hugging Face Spaces with the Gemini 2.0 Flash API.

## 1. Prompt engineering
Remember how an LLM works; it‚Äôs a prediction engine. The model takes sequential text as
an input and then predicts what the following token should be, based on the data it was
trained on. The LLM is operationalized to do this over and over again, adding the previously
predicted token to the end of the sequential text for predicting the following token. The next
token prediction is based on the relationship between what‚Äôs in the previous tokens and what
the LLM has seen during its training.

When you write a prompt, you are attempting to set up the LLM to predict the right sequence
of tokens. Prompt engineering is the process of designing high-quality prompts that guide
LLMs to produce accurate outputs. This process involves tinkering to find the best prompt,
optimizing prompt length, and evaluating a prompt‚Äôs writing style and structure in relation
to the task. In the context of natural language processing and LLMs, a prompt is an input
provided to the model to generate a response or prediction.

## 2. Technology Stack Behind Generative AI

### 2.1 Transformer Architecture
- The Transformer architecture is a deep learning model originally designed for natural language processing (NLP)
- Imagine you're trying to read a story or solve a math problem ‚Äî sometimes you need to look at the entire sentence or equation, not just the words one-by-one. That‚Äôs what Transformers do!

	They can:

	Look at all parts of a sentence at once üîç

	Figure out which words or tokens are most important ‚ö°

	Use attention to focus on important parts (just like you when solving a physics equation).


- Key components: Self-attention, positional encoding, layer normalization

### 2.2 Training Paradigms
- **Self-Supervised Learning**: Used for training LLMs by predicting masked tokens
- **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**: Enhances alignment with human intent

### 2.3 Foundation Models
- GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, Mistral, LLaMA
- Hugging Face Transformers and Diffusers libraries

## 3. Methods and Algorithms

### 3.1 Text Generation
```python
# We are importing something called 'pipeline' from a library named 'transformers'
# This pipeline is like a machine that helps us run smart AI models easily
from transformers import pipeline

# We are telling the pipeline to do "text-generation"
# That means it will try to continue a sentence we give it
# We are using a model called "gpt2", which is a smart AI that knows a lot about language
text_gen = pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt2")

# Now we give it the start of a sentence: "Theoretical Physics is"
# And we tell it to keep going until the total sentence is 50 words long
# Then we print out the result (what the AI writes)
print(text_gen("Theoretical Physics is", max_length=50))

```

```python
[{'generated_text': 'Theoretical Physics is one of the most fascinating areas of science. It explores the fundamental forces, particles, and the very fabric of space and time. Scientists in this field study quantum mechanics, general relativity, and string theory to understand how the universe works at its deepest level.'}]
```

### 3.2 Image Generation (Diffusion)
```python
# We are importing a special art-making tool called "StableDiffusionPipeline" from the diffusers library.
# This tool can turn words into pictures, like magic!
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline

# Now we are choosing a smart artist model called "stable-diffusion-v1-5" to use.
# It's like hiring a robot artist that knows how to paint based on your words.
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5")

# We tell the robot artist what we want: "A quantum computer in a futuristic lab"
# The robot thinks for a moment and draws a picture based on that idea.
image = pipe("A quantum computer in a futuristic lab").images[0]

# Finally, we show the image it created on the screen!
image.show()
```

### 3.3 Code Generation
```python
# We import special tools from Hugging Face to work with AI models.
# "transformers" helps us load smart models that understand and generate code or text.
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# "torch" is a toolbox that helps AI models think using numbers (called tensors).
import torch

# We download a "tokenizer" that breaks down words or code into tiny pieces (tokens),
# and later helps put them back together. This tokenizer is trained to understand code!
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("Salesforce/codegen-350M-mono")

# We load a small but smart code-writing AI model.
# This model has learned how to complete or write Python code by studying many examples.
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("Salesforce/codegen-350M-mono")

# Now we give the model the start of a Python function:
# "def quantum_fourier_transform(n):"
# The tokenizer turns this text into numbers the AI can understand.
inputs = tokenizer("def quantum_fourier_transform(n):", return_tensors="pt")

# The model thinks for a bit and tries to complete the code.
# max_length=100 means it will stop after writing 100 tokens (words/pieces).
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=100)

# Finally, we take the numbers the model gave us and turn them back into readable text.
# This will print the completed Python code!
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))
```

```python
pip install transformers torch
Expected Output:
The model will generate a Python function like:
def quantum_fourier_transform(n):
    import numpy as np
    from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
    qc = QuantumCircuit(n)
    for j in range(n):
        qc.h(j)
        for k in range(j+1, n):
            qc.cu1(np.pi/float(2**(k-j)), k, j)
    return qc

```
üß¨ The Gen AI Method Behind It
üîÑ Causal Language Modeling
The model is trained to predict the next token, like completing a sentence.

This is like how physics-informed models predict the next physical state.

üß± Transformer Architecture
The model uses a Transformer decoder to understand context and generate coherent code.

üì¶ Model: Salesforce/codegen-350M-mono
Fine-tuned on Python and code-related tasks.

Ideal for writing code from docstrings, function headers, or algorithm names.

## 5. Integration: Hugging Face Spaces with Gemini 2.0 Flash API

### 5.1 Creating a Hugging Face Space
- Use `gradio` or `streamlit` as front-end
- Deploy model using HF Hub

### 5.2 Sample Space (Gradio + Gemini)
```python
# We are using two tools:
# gradio ‚Üí makes a website where we can ask questions
# requests ‚Üí helps us talk to the Gemini robot on the internet
import gradio as gr
import requests

# This function sends your question (prompt) to the Gemini AI
def query_gemini(prompt):
    # This is the pretend URL for Gemini's brain (not real in this example)
    url = "https://api.gemini.flash/v2/query"
    
    # This is how we prove we have permission to talk to Gemini
    headers = {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY>"  # Replace this with your real API key!
    }

    # We put your question into a package to send to Gemini
    data = {"input": prompt}

    # We send the package to Gemini using a POST request
    response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)

    # Gemini sends back an answer ‚Äî we open the package and get the answer
    return response.json()["output"]

# Now we build the little website box:
# - You type a question (input)
# - Gemini gives an answer (output)
iface = gr.Interface(
    fn=query_gemini,    # When you hit enter, it calls this function
    inputs="text",      # The input is a text box
    outputs="text"      # The output is shown as plain text
)

# This starts the little website so you can use it
iface.launch()

```
